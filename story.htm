<h2 id="story1"> Our Story </h2> 

<div class="timeloc">
<p>We met in 1974 in the city of Nikšic in Yugoslavia - what is now 
Montenegro.  I was still working in Classics,
sent undercover by the APA to look into what the Soviets have
uncovered about ancient Scythia.  We couldn't
let the Soviets have sole access to that knowledge.  It would be worse
than that time that German guy found
the Ark of the Covenant. Anyway, we met in a Karaoke bar in the

Estonian part of town.  She was singing
<i>99 Luftbaloons</i> in broken Serbian.  I was drinking Cherry "Cola."  They
don't serve Pepsi, not even Coke,
just some god awful knock-off they call Cockta. She was wearing

parachute pants printed with houseflies.
I told her I liked them.  She bought me another Cockta.  And a donut.
They have donuts in Yugoslavia.
Very tasty.  I like donuts.  We talked for a while, and played knifey-spoony.
It's an Austrian game. She won all five rounds.  I told her I used to play
for the Knicks.  She had no idea what that was, but pretended to be
impressed.  We hit it off right away,
mostly because of those charming housefly pants and her ability to
speak coherent English.  I guess I must
have impressed her somehow, because she decided to warn me. The Trio
of Archeologists I was working with
to uncover the ancient Scythian hollow bone tube technology were
actually agents of the Yugoslav Philological
Secret Police.  </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to be aprehended with those bones, well,
knock-off cola would be the least of my
worries when I was dragged off to the Great Pit of Carcoon, or the
nearest Eastern European equivalent.
Needless to say, Kira concealed me from that cadre of Communist
classicists.  She then smuggled us to Belfast
in a shipment of rubber ducks, calling on her connections in the Oriental
Trading Company.  We've been together
ever since.  This past January, I thought it might be time to make
things more official with
a serious exchange of looks, so one night at dinner, I gave her a
ring.  She asked, "What's this?"  "It's a ring,"
I told her, "the kind that's pregnant with meaning and portentous of
marriage."  She said, "Oh," and put it on.
I took that to mean "Yes," but I can't really be sure.  I guess we'll
see if she shows up.
</br>
Either that or we met in college.  I get so confused.
