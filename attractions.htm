<h3> Food </h3> 
<p class ="smallContent">
<b>Handel's Homemade Ice Cream</b></br>
This is the best ice cream in the world.  If you do nothing else while you're in town, go here.
Honestly.  It's right across the street from the Holiday Inn.  You can walk there.</br>
 <a id="smallLink" style="color:#6699CC; " href="http://www.handelsicecream.com/home/index.html">Official Site</a>
</p>
<p class ="smallContent">
<b>Caffè  Capri</b></br>
A local favorite for quality Italian dining, endorsed by Todd's Grandparents.  High-quality Italian food
in an informal yet upscale atmosphere with reasonable prices.  Youngstown is full of Italian people.
Many of them eat here.</br>

</p>
<p class ="smallContent">
<b>The MVR</b></br>
The MVR -- Mahoning Valley Restaurant, for short -- is run by a fourth-generation Youngstown family and 
serves Italian-American food. If you don't like red sauce, hot peppers, escarole in oil, doughy pizza, 
wedding soup (hel-lo!), salads topped with French fries and melted cheese, sandwiches named after football
coaches, beer-battered fish, or live(!) bocce, don't dine here. If you like any of the above, you will love 
it even more at the MVR. Also, it's a stone's roll away from the Butler and McDonough Museums. </br>

<p class ="smallContent">
<b>Arby's</b></br>
Founded in Boardman in 1964, Arby's Restaurant serves the very finest thinly sliced slow-roasted beef on 
fresh buns which can only be described as "gourmet."  Their "french fries" are uniquely spiced with love
and fairy dust then wound into a delightful curl.  Also offered are deli sandwiches, thick delicious milk shakes, 
and an appetizer menu replete with every kind of culinary delight.  I'm thinking Arby's.</br>
